<h1>Hi, I'm Aynalem! <br/><a href="https://github.com/AynalemN"></a></h1>
<p> Cloud Security Engineer | DevSecOps | AWS | IAM & VPC Network Security

I am a Cloud Security Engineer and DevSecOps practitioner with a strong background in Computer Science, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity, supported by two Master’s degrees in Computer Science and IoT with Cybersecurity.

I specialize in AWS cloud security, IAM security, and VPC network security, with hands-on experience designing, securing, monitoring, and responding to security events in cloud environments. My work focuses on secure-by-design architectures, least-privilege access control, network segmentation, and automated security controls aligned with industry frameworks and best practices. </p>

<h2> 🧪 Security & Cloud Projects</h2>

<h3>AWS Logging, SIEM & Threat Detection</h3>
Implemented centralized logging and threat detection using AWS CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and CloudWatch. Simulated unauthorized API calls, IAM privilege escalation, and suspicious login activity with alerting and investigation workflows.

<h3>Cloud Incident Response Playbook (NIST SP 800-61)</h3>
Designed and documented an incident response playbook covering detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned for cloud security incidents.

<h3>Secure IoT Cloud Architecture</h3>
Built a secure IoT environment using AWS IoT Core with TLS-encrypted device communication, IAM-based access control, and threat modeling for device hijacking and data exfiltration scenarios.

<h3>Secure AWS Infrastructure with Terraform</h3>
Deployed VPCs, subnets, IAM roles, and security groups using Terraform with secure defaults, least-privilege policies, and logging enabled by design.
